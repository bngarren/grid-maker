- Rethinking how TemplateEditor works. 
   - If an element is the sole element on a row, it can be selected as "text_multiline" which applies fillHeight true to the row and makes the element a textarea in the Editor
   - Otherwise, elements that are part of a multi-element row can be "text_single"
   - The indexElement selection should be a separate dropdown menu to the right of the TemplateEditor. This will enforce that at least 1 element serves as an indexElement at all times
      - "The "index" element should be unique and is used to order the grid items"
   - Each ElementPopover should include:
      - Name field
      - Type selection (single, multiline, placeholder)
      - Draw borders checkbox
      - Font style: center, bold
      - Delete element button
